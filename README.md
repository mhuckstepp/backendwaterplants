I built this app to help people remember to water their plants at the right time. The site checks local weather to update watering schedule when it rains and sends email notifications to users to water.

Built with React, Redux, Node, Express, Postgres, Knex, bcrpyt, JWT, Styled Components, Heroku Scheduler, SendGrid API, OpenWeather API
